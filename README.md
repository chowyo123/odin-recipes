# odin-recipes
This is the first project in The Odin Project. It will use HTML knowledge learned so far to build a basic recipe website.

Used GIT, directory structuring, HTML boilerpate, html tags such as links, headers, images, paragraphs, and unordered and orders lists.

Lessons learned: need to improve on committing early and often. Atomic commits. I only committed once I was done, but it may have been better to think in smaller chunks.
